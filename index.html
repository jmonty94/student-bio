            <p>My name is James and I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Marin and Sonoma Counties of California. I have a 1 year old son and daughter due in August. My wife and I currently live in Petaluma, CA but have a dream of moving to Hawai'i in approximately 5 years.</p>
            <p>I decided to pursue a career in Web Development becuase I currently work for a major software company at the moment and would like to advance my career within my company. It is my hope that after this course I can advance and take on a larger role within my company.</p>
